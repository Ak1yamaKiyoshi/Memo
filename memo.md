As soon as simply writing notes does not really solves the problem of forgetting everything
I want to stir the ship: using spaced repetition techniques to actually remember stuff!

For that i need more data in each memory:
  - vector<time_t> viewed; // when memory was viewed. 

So, if there is linked memories to some other, I can show them and prompt user
 to recall content of desired one. 

It would be as separate mode, but sounds kinda interesting, allowing the app to be used as learning platform too. But not as effective as "Anki".

Also, the interesting part is analysis of notes, statistics:
 - repeated words, tags, most viewed notes, defining about what user actually thinks the most 

For some reason I feel like I can make the process of writing and remembering own memories a bit funnier. Not with only ASCII art at start of the program but with some kind of minigame.
